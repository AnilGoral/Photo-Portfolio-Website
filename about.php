              <h2><center> Our Mission</center></h2>
              <p> We are a group comprised of students from the IB Diploma Program of İstek Özel Acıbadem High School in İstanbul, and our English teacher Mason Legare Hay, who were inspired by the story and journeys of Albert Khan, a millionaire, philanthropist and photographer. He dedicated his life to creating an “archive of the World”, a collection of photos and visuals depicting the everyday but nonetheless intriguing inhabitants and activities of our World.
             </p>

             <p>His goals are exactly what we aimed to replicate with our own photographs. We tried to tell the stories and tales of our beautiful city, İstanbul. In these archives, or chronicles if you will, you are going to find the breathtaking artistry and jaw-dropping pictures our students who put effort, time and energy into capturing the vibrancy and color of this amazing city. We hope to keep the dreams and legacy of Albert Khan through our own visual chronicles and we sincerely hope you enjoy and savor the contents of this webpage. </p>
